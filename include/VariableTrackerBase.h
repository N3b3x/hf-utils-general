 * @brief Specifies the type of slope calculation to be performed on a set of data points.
 *
 * This enumeration represents the various ways in which the slope, derived from a set of data points, can be calculated or represented:
 *
 * - AVERAGE: Represents the average slope across all data points.
 * - MAXIMUM: Represents the highest slope value among the data points.
 * - MINIMUM: Represents the lowest slope value among the data points.
 * - CHANGE: Represents the largest change between two consecutive slope values.
 * - LAST: Represents the most recent (or last) slope value from the data points.
 *
 * Depending on the use case, one may choose an appropriate `SlopeCalculationType` to get meaningful insights from the dataset.
