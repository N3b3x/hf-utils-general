/// CURRENT SOFTWARE VERSION
//==============================================================//

/**
 * @brief Defines the software version.
 *
 * The software version is represented by three components: major, minor, and build numbers.
 * These components should be incremented based on the nature of the changes made to the software.
 *
 * - **Major Version**: Incremented for significant changes that may include backward-incompatible changes,
 *   major new features, or substantial improvements. For example, if the current version is 2.0.0001 and a major
 *   update is made, the new version should be 3.0.0000.
 *
 * - **Minor Version**: Incremented for backward-compatible changes that add functionality or improvements.
 *   This includes adding new features or enhancements that do not break existing functionality. For example,
 *   if the current version is 2.0.0001 and a minor update is made, the new version should be 2.1.0000.
 *
 * - **Build Number**: Incremented for small changes, bug fixes, or other minor updates that do not add new
 *   functionality or significantly alter existing functionality. This is typically incremented with each build
 *   or release. For example, if the current version is 2.0.0001 and a bug fix is made, the new version should be 2.0.0002.
 *
 * Example:
 * SoftwareVersion softwareVersion(2, 0, 0001);
 * - Major version: 2
 * - Minor version: 0
 * - Build number: 0001
